# # Chip Observer

# Defines an observer class which represents a bound `getter` function. Whenever that `getter` returns a new value the
# `callback` is called with the value.
# 
# If the old and new values were either an array or an object, the `callback` also
# receives the an array of splices (for an array), or an array of change objects (for an object) which are the same
# format that `Array.observe` and `Object.observe` return <http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe>.

  # Syncs this observer now, calling the callback immediately if there have been changes
  sync: ->
    value = @getter()

    # using array filters in chip-each)

  #
