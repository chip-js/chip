# # Chip Observer

# Defines an observer class which represents a bound `getter` function. Whenever that `getter` returns a new value the
# `callback` is called with the value.
# 
# If the old and new values were either an array or an object, the `callback` also
# receives the an array of splices (for an array), or an array of change objects (for an object) which are the same
# format that `Array.observe` and `Object.observe` return <http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe>.
class Observer
	
	# An Observer should never be created with it's constructor. Only through `Observer.add()`.
	constructor: (@getter, @callback, @oldValue) ->
	
	
	# Instructs this observer to not call its `callback` on the next sync, whether the value has changed or not
	skipNextSync: ->
		@skip = true
	
	
	# Syncs this observer now, calling the callback immediately if there have been changes
	sync: ->
		value = @getter()
		
		# Don't call the callback if `skipNextSync` was called on the observer
		if @skip
			delete @skip
		# If an array has changed calculate the splices and call the callback. This 
		else if Array.isArray(value) and Array.isArray(@oldValue)
			splices = equality.array value, @oldValue
			@callback(value, @oldValue, splices) if splices.length
