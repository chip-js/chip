# # Chip Binding

# A Binding instance is created for each binding attribute in the DOM. Mostly the Binding class is used as a static
# place to register new bind handlers.
class Binding
	constructor: (@name, @expr) ->
	
	
	# The attribute prefix for all binding attributes. This is the default and may be changed.
	@prefix: 'data-'
	@handlers: []
	
	
	# Adds a binding handler that will be run for each attribute whose name matches `@prefix + name`. The `handler` is
	# a function that receives three arguments: the jQuery element the attribute was on, the value of the attribute
	# (usually an expression), and the controller for this area of the page.
	# 
	# If the handler removes the element from its parent (to store as a template for cloning into repeats or ifs) then
	# processing will stop on the element and its children immediately. This allows you to recurse into the element
	# with new controllers by using `element.bindTo(newChildController)`.
	# 
	# If a new controller is returned from the handler this controller will be used for the remaining handlers and the
	# children of the element.
	# 
	# The `priority` argument is optional and allows handlers with higher priority to be run before those with lower
	# priority. The default is `0`.
	# 
	# **Example:** This binding handler adds pirateized text to an element.
	# ```javascript
	# Binding.addHandler('pirate', function(element, expr, controller) {
	#   controller.watch(expr, function(value) {
	#     value = (value+'' || '')
	#       .replace(/\Bing\b/g, "in'")
	#       .replace(/\bto\b/g, "t'")
	#       .replace(/\byou\b/, 'ye')
	#       + ' arrrr!'
	#     element.text(value)
	#   }
	# }
	# ```
	# 
	# ```xml
	# <p data-pirate="post.body">This text will be replaced.</p>
	# ```

		@handlers.sort (a, b) -> b.priority - a.priority
	
	
	# Shortcut, adds a handler that executes the expression when the named event is dispatched.
	#
	# **Example:** Handles the click event.
	#```javascript
	# Binding.addEventHandler('click')
	# ```
	# 
	# ```xml
	# <button data-click="window.alert('hello!')">Say Hello</button>
	#```

				controller.eval expr

	@addKeyEventHandler: (name, keyCode, ctrlKey) ->
		@addHandler name, (element, expr, controller) ->
			element.on 'keydown', (event) ->
				return if ctrlKey? and (event.ctrlKey isnt ctrlKey and event.metaKey isnt ctrlKey)
				return unless event.keyCode is keyCode
				event.preventDefault()
				controller.eval expr
	
	
	# Shortcut, adds a handler to set the named attribute to the value of the expression.
	# 
	# **Example**
	# ```javascript
	# Binding.addAttributeHandler('href')
	# ```
	# allows
	# ```xml
	# <a data-href="'/profile/' + person.id">My Profile</a>
	# ```
	# which would result in
	# ```xml
	# <a href="/profile/368">My Profile</a>
	# ```
	@addAttributeHandler: (name) ->
		@addHandler name, (element, expr, controller) ->
			controller.watch expr, (value) ->
				if value?
					element.attr name, value
				else
					element.removeAttr name

	# e.g. `Binding.addAttributeToggleHandler('checked')`.

		@addHandler name, (element, expr, controller) ->
